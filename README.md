SummarAIze ðŸ“„ðŸ¤–
SummarAIze is an AI-powered tool that allows users to upload PDF documents, extract text from them, and generate concise summaries. The summary is then available for download as a report in PDF format. This project integrates multiple AI-driven technologies for seamless document summarization, making it easy for users to quickly get the gist of any PDF.

Features
PDF Upload: Easily upload PDF documents to extract their content.

Text Extraction: AI-powered text extraction from PDF files.

Summarization: Summarizes long PDFs into concise and relevant content using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Downloadable Report: After summarizing the document, users can download a PDF summary report.

Tech Stack
Python: The backend language.

Streamlit: A web application framework to create the frontend interface.

PyMuPDF / PDFMiner: Used for text extraction from PDFs.

Hugging Face Transformers / GPT-3: NLP model for text summarization.

ReportLab: Library to generate PDF reports.

Streamlit Components: To display interactive UI elements like file upload, text display, and PDF download.


How It Works
Upload PDF: The user uploads a PDF file through the file uploader.

Extract Text: The system extracts text from the PDF using a PDF text extraction library.

Summarization: The extracted text is passed through an AI-powered summarizer to generate a concise summary.

Download Summary: The summary is then converted into a downloadable PDF report for the user.

Example Workflow
Upload a PDF document via the file uploader.

The text from the PDF will be displayed in the app.

Click on the "Summarize" button to generate a short summary of the document.

Once the summary is generated, you can download the PDF summary by clicking the "Download Report" button.
